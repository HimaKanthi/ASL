* The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques will help the deaf helps in understanding things in a better and more accurate way. 
* This neural network-based model classifies the signs into 26 alphabets along with space, delete, and nothing gestures.
* The model makes use of the layers such as the Convolution layer, Pooling layer, and fully connected layer to classify the gestures. 
* The dataset used for the building of the model is the ASL Alphabet dataset. The dataset is primarily balanced to increase the efficiency of the model. 
* Then the data is preprocessed and then the preprocessed data is used for the extraction of the underlying features. 
* The extracted features are then classified using various classifiers. 
* Upon using transfer learning, efficient extraction of features and good lighting conditions, the model is able to predict all the classes fairly accurately with an f1 score 90.25%, which is better when compared to f1 score of existed models (82.45%).
